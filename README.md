## Description

This project was created to complete the "[Project: Where's Waldo (A Photo Tagging App)](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-where-s-waldo-a-photo-tagging-app)" from the [Javascript course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript) of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. The goal is to tie together everything I’ve learned so far from the Javascript course.
